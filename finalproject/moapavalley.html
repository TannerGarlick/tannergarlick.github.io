        <h2>Moapa Valley History and Attractions</h2>
        <p id=paragraph>Moapa Valley is in Clark County, Nevada. About an hour drive to Las Vegas. The valley is about 40 miles long and has multiple towns in it. Most locals will either call our town Logandale or Moapa Valley. This is because Moapa Valley consists of 3 towns. These towns include Moapa, Logandale, and Overton. Moapa Valley has a river that runs through the town called the Muddy River. The water comes from a spring and flows into Lake Mead. Many people either that live in Moapa Valley or drive in from surrounding areas will frequently go boating on Lake Mead. Another thing that many people do in Moapa Valley is go off-roading in the desert on ATVs, dirt bikes, razors, trucks, and basically anything with four wheels. </p>
